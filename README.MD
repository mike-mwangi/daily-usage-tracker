# About Project
This project is a fulfilment of Mobile App Development Year 3 Semester 1.

The application called Daily Spend, is a tracker of how much a user spends on a daily.

This is done by filling in a card that requires the item category, note and amount spend on the item.
The spinner contains items personal to my daily spending although it can be adjusted
to suit all user needs.

Authentication is done on login and there is a sign in option by google for new users which is
achieved by using Firebase

Data is stored in Firebase and clears every single day to have new user inputs for the amount
they spend on that day.

There is a toolbar with the option of viewing the currently logged in email also known as "my profile"

Logout implementation is also done for users who wish to switch accounts.
